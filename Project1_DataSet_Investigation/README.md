# DataSet Investigation
In this project, the input data I worked with are sample datasets pulled from Movie Database API. The business decision is trying to find trends about being a successful movie.
1. I investigated a dataset, wrangle into a format and present my findings
2. I also use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make the analysis easier.
