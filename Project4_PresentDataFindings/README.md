# Present data findings
In this project:
1. I use Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. 
2. I produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that I discovered in my selected dataset
