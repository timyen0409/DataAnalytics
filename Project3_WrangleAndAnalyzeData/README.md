# Wrangle and Analyze Data
In this project, the input data I wrangled, analyzed and visualized are the tweet archive of given Twitter users
1. Using Python and its libraries, I gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. 
2. I document your wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and SQL.
