# Analyze A/B Test Results
In this project, the input data I worked with  the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. 

1. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert",
meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. 

2. My contribution is to work through a Jupyter notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, 
keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
