# 2 DataSet Investigation
In this project, the input data I worked with are sample datasets pulled from Movie Database API. The business decision is trying to find trends about being a successful movie.
1. I investigated a dataset, wrangle into a format and present my findings
2. I also use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make the analysis easier.
# 3 Analyze A/B Test Results
In this project, the input data I worked with are the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. 
1. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert",
meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. 
2. My contribution is to work through a Jupyter notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, 
keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
# 4 Wrangle and Analyze Data
In this project, the input data I wrangled, analyzed and visualized are the tweet archive of given Twitter users
1. Using Python and its libraries, I gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. 
2. I document your wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and SQL.

# 5 Present data findings
In this project,  
1. I use Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. 
2. I produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that I discovered in my selected dataset
